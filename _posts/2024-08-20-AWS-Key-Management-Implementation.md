# AWS Key Management Implementation

#

#

## **Introduction**

### **The AWS Key Management Service (KMS) provides secure storage and rotation of encryption keys with robust access control. For a cloud security engineer, it's crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of AWS KMS to ensure the security and integrity of data. Mastery of AWS KMS involves learning how to create, manage, and use cryptographic keys effectively within AWS services and applications. This entails understanding key policies, utilizing both customer-managed and AWS-managed keys, enabling automatic key rotation, and integrating KMS with other AWS services to ensure consistent enforcement of data encryption and access controls.**

#

#

#

# **Objective:**

### Demonstrate the integration of AWS Key Management Service (KMS) with AWS services, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon EBS, to streamline the encryption and decryption process. This involves enabling data encryption within these services without requiring manual key management, showcasing how KMS simplifies secure data handling in cloud environments.

# **Lab implementation**

### Login to your AWS Web console (root account) and create an IAM account.

I created an IAM user “kenya-one” and assigned the user admin privileges. Creating an IAM (Identity and Access Management) user account is recommended rather than using the root user account. An IAM user account provides a more secure way to access and manage AWS resources and services. By creating an IAM user account, you can specify the user’s permissions and restrict their access to only the necessary AWS resources and services. All the activities will be done in the IAM account.  
Click on Services. In the Search field, type KMS and then select Key Management Service. On the KMS Console page, click on Create Key.

There are two types of encryption, **asymmetric** and **symmetric**

| Symmetric encryption involves using a single key for both encryption and decryption of data. This key must be securely shared between the communicating parties. Symmetric encryption is faster and more computationally efficient compared to asymmetric encryption, making it suitable for bulk data encryption. Used for encrypting data at rest (eg, EBS volumes, S3 objects) and protecting data in transit (eg, between AWS services). Asymmetric encryption, on the other hand, uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption, while the private key is used for decryption. It enables secure communication and authentication without the need to share private keys, thus enhancing security in distributed systems and applications. Used for Secure key exchange (eg, encrypting symmetric keys for secure transmission), digital signatures for data integrity and authentication, and SSL/TLS encryption for secure web traffic.
